abstract = {We give algorithms for computing the singular moduli of suitable nonholomorphic modular functions F(z). By combining the theory of isogeny volcanoes with a beautiful observation of Masser concerning the nonholomorphic Eisenstein series E2⁎(z), we obtain CRT-based algorithms that compute the class polynomials HD(F;x), whose roots are the discriminant D singular moduli for F(z). By applying these results to a specific weak Maass form Fp(z), we obtain a CRT-based algorithm for computing partition class polynomials, a sequence of polynomials whose traces give the partition numbers p(n). Under the GRH, the expected running time of this algorithm is O(n5/2+o(1)). Key to these results is a fast CRT-based algorithm for computing the classical modular polynomial Φm(X,Y) that we obtain by extending the isogeny volcano approach previously developed for prime values of m.}

As Serre pointed out, an imaginary quadratic field of class number one gives rise to an integral point on Yns+(n) for suitably chosen n. In this note, we give a genus formula for the modular curves Xns+(n) and we give three new solutions to the class number one problem using the modular curves Xns+(n) for n=16,20,21. These are the only such modular curves of genus ⩽2 that had not yet been exploited.}

abstract = { A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed to be able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time by at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems that are generally thought to be hard on classical computers and that have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, for example, the number of digits of the integer to be factored. }

One example for a QC-MDPC KEM is the Round-2 candidate of the NIST PQC standardization project, ``BIKE''. We have recently shown that the Black-Gray decoder achieves the required properties. In this paper, we define several new variants of the Black-Gray decoder. One of them, called Black-Gray-Flip, needs only 7 steps to achieve a smaller DFR than Black-Gray with 9 steps, for the same block size. On currentplatforms, our BIKE-1 (Level-1) constant-time decapsulation is {\$}{\$}1.9{\backslash}times {\$}{\$} faster than the previous decapsulation with Black-Gray. We also report an additional {\$}{\$}1.25{\backslash}times {\$}{\$} decapsulating speedup using the newandinstructions available on ``Ice-Lake'' micro-architecture.",

abstract = {This chapter presents a study of graph substructures and corresponding error patterns involved in decoding failures on various channels under different iterative message passing and linear programming decoding algorithms. The intriguing structural dependence among these subgraphs, called trapping sets, suggests a comprehensive framework for studying the error floor performance of LDPC codes, as well as for designing codes with guaranteed error floor performance on the binary symmetric channel, additive white Gaussian noise channel and other channels. The problem treated in this chapter is one of the major challenges in modern coding theory. The topological relationship among trapping sets advances our fundamental understanding of the relationship between graphical code representations and the performance of iterative decoding algorithms on several core channel models. In particular, it serves as a foundation for elucidating the relationship between various decoding algorithms and lead to the design of LDPC codes with a superior performance in the error floor region.}

abstract="The security of code-based cryptography is strongly related to the hardness of generic decoding of linear codes. The best known generic decoding algorithms all derive from the Information Set Decoding algorithm proposed by Prange in 1962. The ISD algorithm was later improved by Stern in 1989 (and Dumer in 1991). Those last few years, some significant improvements have occurred. First by May, Meurer, and Thomae at Asiacrypt 2011, then by Becker, Joux, May, and Meurer at Eurocrypt 2012, and finally by May and Ozerov at Eurocrypt 2015. With those methods, correcting w errors in a binary linear code of length n and dimension k has a cost {\$}{\$}2^{\{}cw(1+{\backslash}mathbf {\{}o{\}}(1)){\}}{\$}{\$}when the length n grows, where c is a constant, depending of the code rate k / n and of the error rate w / n. The above ISD variants have all improved that constant c when they appeared.",

abstract = {We present experimental findings on the decoding failure rate (DFR) of BIKE, a fourth-round candidate in the NIST Post-Quantum Standardization process, at the 20-bit security level. We select parameters according to BIKE design principles and conduct a series of experiments. We directly compute the average DFR on a range of BIKE block sizes and identify both the waterfall and error floor regions of the DFR curve. We then study the influence on the average DFR of three sets C, N, and 2N of near-codewords—vectors of low weight that induce syndromes of low weight—defined by Vasseur in 2021. We find that error vectors leading to decoding failures have small maximum support intersection with elements of these sets; further, the distribution of intersections is quite similar to that of sampling random error vectors and counting the intersections with C, N, and 2N. Our results indicate that these three sets are not sufficient in classifying vectors expected to cause decoding failures. Finally, we study the role of syndrome weight on the decoding behavior and conclude that the set of error vectors that lead to decoding failures differ from random vectors by having low syndrome weight.},

abstract="We improve our proposal of a new variant of the McEliece cryptosystem based on QC-LDPC codes. The original McEliece cryptosystem, based on Goppa codes, is still unbroken up to now, but has two major drawbacks: long key and low transmission rate. Our variant is based on QC-LDPC codes and is able to overcome such drawbacks, while avoiding the known attacks. Recently, however, a new attack has been discovered that can recover the private key with limited complexity. We show that such attack can be avoided by changing the form of some constituent matrices, without altering the remaining system parameters. We also propose another variant that exhibits an overall increased security level. We analyze the complexity of the encryption and decryption stages by adopting efficient algorithms for processing large circulant matrices. The Toom-Cook algorithm and the short Winograd convolution are considered, that give a significant speed-up in the cryptosystem operations.",
