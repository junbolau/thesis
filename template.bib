abstract = {Let Yns+(n) be the open non-cuspidal locus of the modular curve Xns+(n) associated to the normalizer of a non-split Cartan subgroup of level n. As Serre pointed out, an imaginary quadratic field of class number one gives rise to an integral point on Yns+(n) for suitably chosen n. In this note, we give a genus formula for the modular curves Xns+(n) and we give three new solutions to the class number one problem using the modular curves Xns+(n) for n=16,20,21. These are the only such modular curves of genus ⩽2 that had not yet been exploited.}

abstract = { A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed to be able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time by at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems that are generally thought to be hard on classical computers and that have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, for example, the number of digits of the integer to be factored. }

abstract="QC-MDPC code-based KEMs rely on decoders that have a small or even negligible Decoding Failure Rate (DFR). These decoders should be efficient and implementable in constant-time. One example for a QC-MDPC KEM is the Round-2 candidate of the NIST PQC standardization project, ``BIKE''. We have recently shown that the Black-Gray decoder achieves the required properties. In this paper, we define several new variants of the Black-Gray decoder. One of them, called Black-Gray-Flip, needs only 7 steps to achieve a smaller DFR than Black-Gray with 9 steps, for the same block size. On currentplatforms, our BIKE-1 (Level-1) constant-time decapsulation is {\$}{\$}1.9{\backslash}times {\$}{\$} faster than the previous decapsulation with Black-Gray. We also report an additional {\$}{\$}1.25{\backslash}times {\$}{\$} decapsulating speedup using the newandinstructions available on ``Ice-Lake'' micro-architecture.",
