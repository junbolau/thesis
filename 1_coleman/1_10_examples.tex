\chapter{Computations and examples}

In the previous chapter, we outlined an algorithm to compute single Coleman integrals on modular curves between any two known points. The modular curves in consideration come from Serre's Uniformity Conjecture, i.e., they are of the form $X = X_H(N) := \HH^+/\Gamma_H(N)$ and they satisfy:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\Gamma_H(N) \leq \SL_2(\ZZ)$ where $H \leq \GL_2(\ZZ/N\ZZ)$,
\item $- I \in H$,
\item $\det: H \rightarrow \ZZ/N\ZZ$ is surjective.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, we also consider quotients of modular curves by the action of Atkin-Lehner involutions. We will demonstrate three classes of examples, namely, $X_0(N)$, $X_0^+(N)$, and $X_{ns}^+(N)$, while gathering the necessary ingredients such as known rational points, basis of differentials and the action of the Hecke operators to perform Coleman integration.
