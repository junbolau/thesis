%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.

%  To two, the loneliest number since the number one.

\begin{abstract}
In this dissertation, we study two problems arising from arithmetic geometry.

Falting's theorem states that there are only finitely many rational points on curves of genus greater than 1. However, an explicit determination of all such points on a curve remains a hard problem. There are various approaches to computing rational points on higher genus curves and we use Coleman's theory of $p$-adic line integrals to study a particular class of curves with rich arithmetic origins, namely, the modular curves. In join work with Chen and Kedlaya, we implement a new algorithm that does not use the models of the modular curves and illustrate this method through the computation of several examples.

On the other hand, in anticipation of the development of powerful quantum computers in the next few decades, we study cryptosystems that rely on the hardness of certain number theoretical problems. In particular, we investigate BIKE, a cryptosystem presented as one of the candidates for the National Institute of Standards and Technology Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process. We identified several factors that affect the security of the code-based cryptosystem as a potential quantum-attack-resistant candidate for real world applications through extensive simulations.
